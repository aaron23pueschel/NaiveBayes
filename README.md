# NaiveBayes

### Implementation of the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm using sklearn on the 20news dataset. 
#### I made this project to give me some experience in using sklearn libraries for unsupervised multi-class classification. Currently, I have only implemented multinomial naive bayes, but I hope to expand the project by allowing the user to choose between types of naive bayes algorithms and vectorizers.
#### To test, file simply run the file NB.py using the command:
#### **python NB.py** 
#### If the 20news dataset is not in your current working directory, the necessary files will be automatically downloaded and parsed.
